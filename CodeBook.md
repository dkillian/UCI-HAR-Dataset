This data set includes movement data collected from accelerometers in samsung phones
This data is represented in 3 axes- X,y,Z and the units of measurement are in g (for gravity)
The data is subdivided by subject- 1 to 30
The activity is divided into walking, walking upstairs, walking, downstairs, standing, sitting and laying

Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
The measurement data includes:
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 

Every row shows a 128 element vector. 
- The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

The data used in this project includes only the means and std deviations for the individual measurements
